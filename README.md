Trash Panda is an app that helps you to recycle better. You may search through a list of categories, enter in a material to our search bar, or (soon) use your camera to scan and item to discover how to properly dispose of your material! A lot of things end up in garbage bags sent off to the landfill when they might have a better way of being disposed. With Trash Panda, you will become wiser at disposing items and be better to our planet!

### Key Features

- Ability to navigate through categories to select your material and receive it's proper disposal method.
- Ability to search for your exact item and learn it's proper disposal method.
- Ability to use your device's camera to find what your item is, then proper disposal.
- Using any method above, then find a location nearby that may accept item (if applicable).
- Discover name, hours, phone, and address of location in which your item may be brought to for disposal.

# APIs

## Authentication API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy¬†... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## Payment API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.
